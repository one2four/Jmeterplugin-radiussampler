# Jmeterplugin-radiussampler

This is a Jmeter plugin used to send Radius requests to the radius server. This comes handy in testing the radius server with jmeter.

The code has been forked from https://github.com/smoeding/Jmeterplugin-radiussampler

## Installation

Copy the file `RadiusSampler.jar` to the `lib/ext` directory of your Jmeter installation. You can then add the _Radius Protocol Sampler_ to your testplan.
